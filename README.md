# BBDraft  
<img src="http://laken.pw/bbdraft/art/bbdraft-logo.png" width="350px">  
BBDraft is a PHP-based web app for playing Fantasy Big Brother (US & CA version). It is written in Object-Oriented PHP 7.1, and uses the Twig templating engine.  
BBDraft is still in its early development stage. At one point it was getting rather far along, but I decided to start over from scratch with OOP and a new design.
